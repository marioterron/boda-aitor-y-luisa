# UI Development Plan for Wedding Invitation Management Platform

## 1. Objective
The goal of the UI is to provide a clean, elegant, and user-friendly interface that aligns with the wedding theme. The design should highlight essential event details and make it easy for guests to RSVP while maintaining responsiveness and accessibility.

     - Guests provide their name, email, companions, dietary restrictions, and an optional message.
     - A confirmation message is displayed after submission.
   - The "RSVP" button in the navigation bar or hero section scrolls smoothly to this RSVP section.
